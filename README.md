## About <a name = "about"></a>

In the scorching sun of the desert, and the sand filled wind blowdin hot ait on the player's face. The player is mean to make it across the savanna. Mapless! However, the Camel has hints for the player, the camel also has a water reserve in case teh player is dehydrated. It is possible fo the player to die form dehydration in this harsh desert. The player also needs to stay away from cacti, rattle snakes, camelSpiders (yea they're a thing) and any enemies on the way. The player only has villagers as friends and the camel. As you travel through this savanna conserve your energy (there's a dehydration rate that auomatically gorges upon your hydration value), find the camel, get the hints to the oasis. Evade enemies if you haven't yet gotten to the oasis to prevent wating your energy. Get to the oasis and drink up, fight your foes and get a cross the Savanna. Then you're safe. Good Luck!! Haha!
